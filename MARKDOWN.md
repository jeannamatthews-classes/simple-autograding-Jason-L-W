What is the difference between a text file and a markdown file?

A textfile as the name implies is a text file where it doesn't allow formatting such has headings, bold, italics, and etc.
On the other hand a markdown file allows you to do this.

For example,
# first-level heading
## second-leveling heading
### third-level heading

This is a **bold** word
This is an *italic* word
This is a ~~strikethrough~~
